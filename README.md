A simple Student Information System that can handle add, search, edit and delete records.

Create a database with xampp called "student_db" with 2 tables. The first being called "login" with these parameters: 
4 colums
id  int  AI
username  varchar(50)  null(yes)
usertype varchar(50)  null(yes)
password varchar(50)  null(yes)

Add 2 users with credentials to your liking but one being admin and the other being student as their usertypes.

Next table is called "students". Create with these parameters:
5 columns
